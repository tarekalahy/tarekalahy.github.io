## Introduction

As an open-source project, the Readium Foundation welcomes contributions from everyone - from individuals, groups and corporations. The best way to get started with Readium is to read through the introductory materials on this site, subscribe to the mailing list and, of course, get the source code and start spelunking through it.

An important note to bear in mind is that YOU are the Readium team. Readium has no "dedicated team". Other than a consultant or two and a couple of part-time employees, everything in Readium is done by the Readium contributors - some employed by Readium Foundation members, some simply individual contributors.

## Project Communication

### Mailing List

There is an active mailing list for the Readium projects. To join, simply send mail to [Ric Wright](rkwright@readium.org), requesting access. Alternatively, visit the [Google Readium mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/readium-dev) page (where you can also browse the archives) and request access.

### The Weekly Meetings

There are three regular Readium Meetings each week:

- Readium-1 Engineering:	Tuesdays at 16.00h UTC,
- Readium-2 Engineering:	Wednesdays at 16.00h UTC,
- Readium Triage/Planning:	Thursdays at 16.00h UTC.

<em>Note:  The meetings are at 1600 UTC during the summer (in daylight savings) and 1700 UTC in the winter (non-daylight savings).</em>

All three meetings are hosted in GoToMeeting with the same call-in info:

- Access Code: 334-772-733,

- **Use your microphone and speakers (VoIP) - a headset is recommended.**

An invitation to each meeting and a separate agenda for each meeting and all the login and call-in info is sent out to the readium-dev mailing list each week.

### Slack - Real-time Chat

The Readium Dev group uses Slack for real-time chats.

Head here to get an invite:
[http://readium-slack.herokuapp.com](http://readium-slack.herokuapp.com)

The actual Readium chat room is here:
[https://readium.slack.com](https://readium.slack.com)

(several channels in there, including "sdk", "concall", etc.)
During meetings, we use the “concall” channel to post links, etc. Other times, the “general” channel is most often used.

### Face to Face Meetings

Several times a year (it varies) we try to arrange a face-to-face meeting of the developers and contributors. These usually but not always coicide with Readium membership meetings and/or major eBook conferences like Book Expo America, etc.

### Meeting Archives

The agenda and notes from all the meetings are archived in the Readium Google doc tree. Access to all the archives can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzaNaBNAB6FjRmFocHotbV9nMFU?hl=en).

### The ReadiumJS Meeting

The ReadiumJS meeting is focused primarily on the Readium Chrome Extension and CloudReader development. However, since the JS and SDK sides share the readium-shared-js layer, there is often a little bit of overlap.

### The Readium SDK Meeting

The Readium SDK meeting is of course focused primarily on the SDK development. However, there is often a little bit of overlap with ReadiumJS. The SDK meeting also covers some of the DRM-related development.

### The Triage/Planning Meeting

The Thursday meeting varies in its content, but tends to be broader in scope than the JS or SDK engineering meetings. Sometimes if focuses on reviewing the open issues or some particular topic (e.g. user interface changes to the Chrome Extension, etc.). Other times, the meeting focuses on planning for one or more facets of the project over the near or medium term. Longer term planning tends to be held at the membership and board level.
